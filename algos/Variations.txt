NMFF-stronger-corners:
    Instead of only reinforcing the corner where the door is, reinforce both corners based on breach locations
    This seems low risk for causing regression in performance and I've seen close games were better "off" corner
    defense seems prudent

NMFF-SC-RE:
    NMFF-stronger-corners, plus reinforcing at >= 27 (instead of 30) as that means we've built the full wall-ish.
    Also we had only been counting filters up to now ... oops
