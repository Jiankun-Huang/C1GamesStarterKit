NMFF-stronger-corners:
    Instead of only reinforcing the corner where the door is, reinforce both corners based on breach locations
    This seems low risk for causing regression in performance and I've seen close games were better "off" corner
    defense seems prudent

NMFF-SC-RE:
    NMFF-stronger-corners, plus reinforcing at >= 27 (instead of 30) as that means we've built the full wall-ish.
    Also we had only been counting filters up to now ... oops

NMFF-SC2-RE:
    Added a filter in front of the tower to better stop corner attacks

NMFF-SC2-RE2:
    If we can threaten their spawns, do it. We remove the spawn from the list when we threaten it, in case they
    change spawn points.

NMFF-2-2-no:
    Same as above, no attacking turn zero. Will use pings if a path is safe on turn 1

SKUNKWORKS
    When we can threaten their EMP spawn, do it!

I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO WIN AN EMP WAR
    Maybe the only way to win is to not fight? -> Avoid the threat of enemy spawn point and let DESTRUCTORs do the work??
