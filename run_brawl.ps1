# This is a PowerShell script to run a bunch of games with a single command.
# This is intended for when you have worked out all bugs and are testing to see if a new strategy really is better than an old one.

# This program assumes this file is in the main engine directory (eg dir with README and engine.jar)
# You can change this of course, but that is on you :).

# Inside $runprog you can see that there is the execution "scripts/run_match.ps1 algos/my-bot algos/starter-algo" (line 48).
# This should be the same command you use to start your game locally. So change "my-bot" to be whatever the name is of your algo directory.

# The script at the end is a seperate python file that looks at all the replay files and tells you how many each player won.

# You call this script in PowerShell by running .\[THIS_FILE_NAME] [NUM_OF_GAMES] [BATCH_SIZE]

# An example would be: .\run_multiple 20 5
# This would run the game 20 times with only 5 games running at a time.

# You can leave out a batch size and the default is set to 5 (of course you can edit this below)
# so this command would do the same thing: .\run_multiple 20

# DO NOT RUN WITH A LARGE BATCH SIZE (like >15, depending on your computer) or else it will take forever and crash

# If you have questions just ask me on the forums - @Isaac
