'''

This is a python script to check all replay files in the /replays folder.
It looks at each file and simply looks for a string to see which player won.

This program assumes this file is in the main engine directory (eg dir with README and engine.jar)
It also assumes the "replays" folder exists.
You can change this of course, but that is on you :).

If you have questions just ask me on the forums - @Isaac
